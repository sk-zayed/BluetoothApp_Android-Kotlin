# BluetoothApp_Android-Kotlin

Hello,

It is a Bluetooth data transfer app coded in Kotlin.

I have built this app for my "Home Automation System" project.

In this project I have built a circuit which communicates with mobile app via bluetooth and controls the electric appliances. User can turn on and off the electric appliances connected to the circuit through the application.

Components used:
  <ul>
    <li>Arduino Uno Board</li>
    <li>HC-05 Bluetooth module</li>
    <li>Relay module</li>
    <li>LM-53 Temperature sensor</li>
    <li>Photoresistor (LDR sensor)</li>
  </ul>
